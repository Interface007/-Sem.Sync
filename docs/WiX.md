# WiX Setup
Homepage: [http://sourceforge.net/projects/wix](http://sourceforge.net/projects/wix)
The Windows Installer XML (WiX) is a toolset that builds Windows installation packages from XML source code.
This project does use the version 3.5 which you can download from [http://wix.sourceforge.net/releases/](http://wix.sourceforge.net/releases/) to integrate setup generation as a build project into the solution. You might skip installing this if you don't want to build setup (msi) files.
